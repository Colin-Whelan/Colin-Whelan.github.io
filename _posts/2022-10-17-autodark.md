Over the past couple months I created a tool to help with creating darkmode styles for email that I call [Autodark](https://autodark.glitch.me/).  
**Note: The color scheme of your system must be set to 'Dark' for this to work.** 

This was created to help preview how darkmode can look for templates without having to put in any real effort or have any technical knowledge.  
  
Just paste your HTML email into the box on the left and a preview of what darkmode can look like will show on the right.
If the colors dont match your needs, try adjusting the colors until the preview is sufficient.

Each color of the darkmode pallete is customizable and can be saved as a URL so it can be saved for later or shared with others.

I hope this tool helps assist in the adoption of more darkmode designs across email.

### Notes:
This strips all &lt;tbody&gt; tags. These are added by the browser and 99.9% of the time only serve to bloat the HTML.
